How to determine a guess.
  Go through the your memory of the board space by space...
    Record the symbols to a hash as you find them
    If you find a symbol that you've already seen
      Guess that position.
    Otherwise
      If the symbol has not yet been seen...
        Make a record of the fact that we've seen it.
      If the space is blank...
        Add this to our list of blank spaces.

  If you've gotten to this point, you didn't make a guess because you
    didn't find a pair of matching symbols.

    So, go back to your list of blank spaces and guess one of them
